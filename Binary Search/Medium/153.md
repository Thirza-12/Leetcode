# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Statement
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

```
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]  // Rotated 4 times
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]  // Rotated 7 times (same as original order)
```

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the **minimum element** of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time.

## Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using **Binary Search**.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `start = 0` and `end = nums.size() - 1`.
2. While `start <= end`, compute `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.
3. Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[end]`:
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[end]`, the minimum element lies in the **right half**.
   - Otherwise, the minimum element is in the **left half** (including `mid`).
4. Update `start` or `end` accordingly and continue the binary search.
5. Return the minimum value found.

## Code Implementation (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.size() - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[end]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` (Binary Search reduces search space by half in each step).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (No extra space used).

## Example
### Input:
```cpp
nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
```
### Output:
```cpp
1
```
**Explanation:** The original sorted array was `[1,2,3,4,5]`, rotated 3 times.

### Input:
```cpp
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
```
### Output:
```cpp
0
```

## Edge Cases Considered
- The array **is not rotated** (`nums` is already sorted in ascending order).
- The array has only **one element**.
- The smallest element is at the **first or last index**.

## Summary
- Utilizes **binary search** for `O(log n)` complexity.
- Identifies the minimum element efficiently.
- Handles different edge cases effectively.

This ensures an optimal and efficient solution for finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array.
