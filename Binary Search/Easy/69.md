# Square Root (LeetCode 69)

## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator (e.g., `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python).

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
x = 4
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:** The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
x = 8
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

## Solution Approach
We use a **binary search** approach to find the square root efficiently. The key idea is to search within the range `[1, x]` and use a **mid-point** to check if its square is less than or equal to `x`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `start = 1` and `end = x`.
2. Perform a binary search:
   - Calculate `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x`, store `mid` as a potential answer and search in the right half (`start = mid + 1`).
   - Otherwise, search in the left half (`end = mid - 1`).
3. Return the stored answer after the loop ends.

## Code Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = x;
        int ans = 0;
        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log x)`, since we are performing binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we are using only a few integer variables.

## Edge Cases Considered
- `x = 0` and `x = 1` (should return `x` itself)
- Large values of `x` to check efficiency
- Perfect squares like `x = 9, 16, 25, etc.`
- Non-perfect squares like `x = 8, 10, 15, etc.` to ensure correct rounding down behavior
