# Problem: 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays of `nums` whose score is strictly less than `k`.

### Definition of Score:
The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length. For example, the score of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75`.

### Input:
- An array `nums` containing `n` positive integers.
- A positive integer `k`.

### Output:
- The number of non-empty subarrays whose score is strictly less than `k`.

## Approach

We can solve this problem using a sliding window technique to efficiently calculate the subarrays and their scores.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to track the sum of the current subarray.
2. Use a `left` pointer to maintain the left boundary of the subarray, and a `right` pointer to iterate over the array.
3. For each subarray starting from index `left` to index `right`, compute the score, which is the product of its sum and its length.
4. If the score is greater than or equal to `k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the subarray and reduce the score.
5. For each valid subarray (whose score is less than `k`), add the count of valid subarrays (`right - left + 1`) to the result.
6. Return the total count of valid subarrays.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, long long k) {
        long long sum = 0, ans = 0;
        int left = 0, n = nums.size();
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            
            // Shrink the window while the product of sum and length is >= k
            while (left <= right && sum * (right - left + 1) >= k) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            // Add the number of valid subarrays ending at 'right'
            ans += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [2,1,4,3,5]
k = 10
```

**Output:**
```cpp
6
```

**Explanation:**
The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1,1,1]
k = 5
```

**Output:**
```cpp
5
```

**Explanation:**
Every subarray except `[1,1,1]` has a score less than 5. 
`[1,1,1]` has a score `(1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9`, which is greater than 5. Thus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.

## Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the size of the array. We iterate through the array once, and for each element, we adjust the left pointer in the sliding window if necessary.

## Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**. We are only using a few extra variables to store the sum, result, and pointers, so the space complexity is constant.
