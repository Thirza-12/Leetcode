# **3325. Count Substrings With K-Frequency Characters I**

## **Problem Statement**
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the total number of **substrings** of `s` where at least one character appears **at least** `k` times.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

---

## **Example 1:**
### **Input:**
```cpp
s = "abacb", k = 2
```
### **Output:**
```cpp
4
```
### **Explanation:**
The valid substrings are:
- `"aba"` (character 'a' appears **2** times).
- `"abac"` (character 'a' appears **2** times).
- `"abacb"` (character 'a' appears **2** times).
- `"bacb"` (character 'b' appears **2** times).

---

## **Constraints**
- \(1 \leq s.length \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

---

## **Approach**
This problem can be efficiently solved using the **sliding window (two-pointer) technique**.

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Use a frequency array `freq[26]`** to count occurrences of each character in the current window.
2. **Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer**, updating the frequency count.
3. **Shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer** when the count of `s[right]` reaches `k` or more.
4. **Whenever a valid substring is found, count all valid subarrays ending at `right`.**
5. **Summing up all valid substrings gives the final answer.**

---

## **Code Implementation**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0); // Frequency array for 26 lowercase letters
        int n = s.size();
        int left = 0, ans = 0;

        // Sliding window approach
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            freq[s[right] - 'a']++; // Increase frequency of current character

            // When a character appears at least k times, count valid substrings
            while (freq[s[right] - 'a'] >= k) {
                ans += n - right; // All substrings from left to right are valid
                freq[s[left] - 'a']--; // Remove leftmost character from window
                left++; // Shrink window from the left
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

---

## **Explanation of Code**
- **Initialize a frequency array `freq[26]`** to store occurrences of characters.
- **Use two pointers (`left` and `right`)** to maintain a sliding window.
- **Expand `right` pointer**, increasing the frequency count for `s[right]`.
- **Shrink `left` pointer** when `s[right]` appears at least `k` times, counting all valid substrings.
- **Return the total count of valid substrings.**

---

## **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), as each character is processed at most twice (once when added, once when removed).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we use only a fixed-sized frequency array.

---

## **Why Sliding Window?**
- Brute force would check all substrings (**O(nÂ²)**), which is **too slow** for large `n`.
- **Sliding window efficiently processes the string in O(n) time**, making it optimal.
