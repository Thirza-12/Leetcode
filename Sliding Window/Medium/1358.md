# Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters.

### Constraints:
- `3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4`
- `s` only consists of characters `a`, `b`, or `c`

## Example Inputs and Outputs
### Example 1:
**Input:**
```cpp
s = "abcabc"
```
**Output:**
```cpp
10
```
**Explanation:**
Valid substrings: `"abc"`, `"abca"`, `"abcab"`, `"abcabc"`, `"bca"`, `"bcab"`, `"bcabc"`, `"cab"`, `"cabc"`, `"abc"` (again).

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```cpp
s = "aaacb"
```
**Output:**
```cpp
3
```
**Explanation:**
Valid substrings: `"aaacb"`, `"aacb"`, `"acb"`.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```cpp
s = "abc"
```
**Output:**
```cpp
1
```

## Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using the **Sliding Window Technique**:
1. Maintain counts of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the current window.
2. Expand the right boundary of the window until all three characters are present.
3. Once all characters are included, increment the count by `(n - right)`, as all substrings starting from `left` to `right` will be valid.
4. Shrink the left boundary and repeat until all valid substrings are counted.

## Solution Implementation
**C++ Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int aCount = 0, bCount = 0, cCount = 0;
        int ans = 0, left = 0, n = s.size();
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            if (s[right] == 'a') aCount++;
            else if (s[right] == 'b') bCount++;
            else cCount++;
            
            while (aCount && bCount && cCount) {
                ans += n - right;
                if (s[left] == 'a') aCount--;
                else if (s[left] == 'b') bCount--;
                else cCount--;
                left++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `s`. Each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as only a few integer variables are used.

## Edge Cases Considered
- Smallest input size (`s.length == 3`)
- `s` containing only one or two distinct characters, leading to `0` valid substrings
- Large input size (`s.length == 5 x 10^4`), ensuring efficiency of the algorithm
