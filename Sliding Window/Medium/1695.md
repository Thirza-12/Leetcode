# 1695. Maximum Erasure Value

## Problem Description

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`, and your task is to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.

A subarray `b` is defined as a contiguous subsequence of `nums`, i.e., it is equal to `nums[l], nums[l+1], ..., nums[r]` for some indices `l` and `r`.

### Objective

Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [4, 2, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
17
```

**Explanation:**

The optimal subarray is `[2, 4, 5, 6]`, with a sum of 17.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
8
```

**Explanation:**

The optimal subarray can either be `[5, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 5]`, both yielding a sum of 8.

## Approach

The solution uses a sliding window technique along with a hash map (unordered_map in C++) to maintain the uniqueness of the elements in the current subarray. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Sliding Window:**  
   We maintain a window using two pointers (`left` and `right`) where `right` extends the window, and `left` contracts it when duplicate elements are encountered.

2. **Hash Map for Uniqueness:**  
   We use an unordered map to track the frequency of elements in the current window. If an element is repeated, the window is contracted by incrementing the `left` pointer until the duplicate is removed.

3. **Maximizing the Sum:**  
   The sum of the elements in the window is updated by adding the current element at `right` and subtracting the element at `left` when the window is contracted. We keep track of the maximum sum encountered during the process.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumUniqueSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0, ans = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            while (mp[nums[right]]) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                mp[nums[left]]--;
                left++;
            }
            mp[nums[right]]++;
            sum += nums[right];
            ans = max(sum, ans);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice: once when the `right` pointer moves and once when the `left` pointer moves.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the usage of an unordered map to store the frequencies of the elements in the current window.

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum score that can be obtained by erasing a subarray with unique elements using a sliding window and hash map approach.
