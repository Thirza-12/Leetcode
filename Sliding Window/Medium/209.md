# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a **contiguous subarray** whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```
target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
```
**Output:**  
```
2
```
**Explanation:**  
The subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
```
target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
```
**Output:**  
```
1
```

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
```
target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```
**Output:**  
```
0
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= target <= 10^9`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using the **Sliding Window Technique**.

### Algorithm:
1. Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to track the current window.
2. Expand the window by moving `right` and adding `nums[right]` to `sum`.
3. If `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, try to minimize the window by moving `left` while still satisfying the condition.
4. Keep track of the minimum window length.
5. Return the minimum length found, or `0` if no valid subarray exists.

### Code Implementation:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0, left = 0, n = nums.size();
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            
            while (left <= right && sum >= target) {
                ans = min(ans, right - left + 1);
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return ans == INT_MAX ? 0 : ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding `right` and once when shrinking `left`).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as no extra space is used apart from a few integer variables.

## Summary
The sliding window approach efficiently finds the minimal-length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `target`, making it well-suited for large input sizes. The solution runs in linear time, ensuring optimal performance.
