# Problem: 2799. Count Complete Subarrays in an Array

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers, return the number of complete subarrays. 

A subarray is called complete if the number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.

### Input:
- An array `nums` containing `n` positive integers.

### Output:
- The number of complete subarrays.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1,3,1,2,2]
```

**Output:**
```cpp
4
```

**Explanation:**
The complete subarrays are:
- [1,3,1,2]
- [1,3,1,2,2]
- [3,1,2]
- [3,1,2,2]

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [5,5,5,5]
```

**Output:**
```cpp
10
```

**Explanation:**
The array consists only of the integer 5, so every subarray is complete. The number of subarrays is `10`.

## Approach

The goal is to count the number of subarrays that have exactly the same number of distinct elements as the entire array. We can approach this problem using the sliding window (two-pointer) technique and hashing.

### Steps:
1. Count the number of unique elements in the entire array using a hashmap.
2. Use a sliding window approach:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and adding elements to the window.
   - If the number of distinct elements in the current window is equal to the number of unique elements in the entire array, check the subarrays from `left` to `right` and add their counts to the answer.
   - Move the `left` pointer forward to shrink the window while maintaining the count of distinct elements.
3. Return the total number of complete subarrays.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int unique = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        
        // Count the number of unique elements in the entire array
        for(int i : nums) {
            mp[i]++;
            if(mp[i] == 1) {
                unique++;
            }
        }

        int left = 0, ans = 0, count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> subfreq;

        // Sliding window approach
        for(int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            subfreq[nums[right]]++;
            if(subfreq[nums[right]] == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            
            // Shrink the window until the number of distinct elements equals unique
            while(left <= right && count == unique) {
                ans += n - right;
                if(subfreq[nums[left]] == 1) count--;
                subfreq[nums[left]]--;
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of Code:
- The `unordered_map<int, int> mp` is used to count the number of unique elements in the array.
- The `subfreq` map keeps track of the frequency of elements in the current sliding window.
- The `left` and `right` pointers define the current window. As we move the `right` pointer, we check if the current subarray has the same number of distinct elements as the entire array.
- When the condition is met, we count all possible subarrays from `left` to `right` by adding `n - right` to the result.

## Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the size of the array. We iterate through the array twice: once for counting the unique elements and once for the sliding window approach.

## Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** due to the space used by the hashmaps (`mp` and `subfreq`).
