# Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

## Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1's` in the resulting array. Return `0` if there is no such subarray.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Example Inputs and Outputs
### Example 1:
**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1,1,0,1]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
3
```
**Explanation:**
After deleting the number at position `2`, `[1,1,1]` contains `3` numbers with value `1`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
5
```
**Explanation:**
After deleting the number at position `4`, the longest subarray with value `1's` is `[1,1,1,1,1]`.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1,1,1]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
2
```
**Explanation:**
You must delete one element.

## Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using the **Sliding Window Technique**:
1. Maintain a window that contains at most one `0`.
2. Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer.
3. If a second `0` appears, shrink the window from the `left` until only one `0` remains.
4. Keep track of the maximum length encountered.

## Solution Implementation
**C++ Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        bool skipped = false;
        int left = 0, n = nums.size();
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            while (skipped && nums[right] == 0) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) skipped = false;
                left++;
            }
            if (nums[right] == 0) skipped = true;
            ans = max(ans, right - left);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `nums`. Each element is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as only a few integer variables are used.

## Edge Cases Considered
- Smallest input size (`nums.length == 1`)
- `nums` containing all `1's`, requiring deletion of one `1`
- `nums` containing all `0's`, resulting in `0` output
- Large input size (`nums.length == 10^5`), ensuring efficiency of the algorithm
