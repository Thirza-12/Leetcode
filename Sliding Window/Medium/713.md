# Subarray Product Less Than K

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

## Example
### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
8
```
**Explanation:**
The 8 subarrays that have a product less than 100 are:
- `[10]`
- `[5]`
- `[2]`
- `[6]`
- `[10, 5]`
- `[5, 2]`
- `[2, 6]`
- `[5, 2, 6]`

Note that `[10, 5, 2]` is not included as the product is `100`, which is not strictly less than `k`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
0
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= k <= 10^6`

## Solution Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using the **Sliding Window (Two-Pointer) Technique**:
1. Maintain a `pro` variable to store the product of elements within the current window.
2. Expand the right boundary of the window (`right` pointer) by including elements in the product.
3. If the product becomes greater than or equal to `k`, shrink the window from the left (`left` pointer) until the product is less than `k`.
4. The number of valid subarrays ending at each index `right` is `right - left + 1`.
5. Keep adding this count to the answer.

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time since each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding and once when contracting the window).

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a few integer variables.

## Implementation (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 1) return 0;
        int pro = 1, left = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            pro *= nums[right];
            while (pro >= k) {
                pro /= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            ans += right - left + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Edge Cases Considered
- `k = 0` (no valid subarrays can exist)
- `nums` containing large values approaching 1000
- `nums` with minimum length (1) and maximum length (3 * 10^4)

## Conclusion
The Sliding Window approach provides an efficient solution to counting valid subarrays in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes.
