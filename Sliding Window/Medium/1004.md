# Max Consecutive Ones III

## Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1's` in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0's`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```
nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
```
**Output:**  
```
6
```
**Explanation:**  
After flipping two `0's`, the array becomes: `[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]`. The longest contiguous sequence of `1's` has a length of **6**.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
```
nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
```
**Output:**  
```
10
```
**Explanation:**  
After flipping three `0's`, the array becomes: `[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`. The longest contiguous sequence of `1's` has a length of **10**.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`

---

## Solution Approach
We use the **Sliding Window (Two-Pointer)** approach to solve this problem efficiently.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize `left` pointer at `0` and `count` to track the number of flipped `0's`.
2. Iterate `right` pointer through the array.
3. If `nums[right]` is `0`, increment `count`.
4. If `count` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to maintain at most `k` flipped `0's`.
5. Update `ans` with the maximum window size encountered.
6. Return `ans`.

### Code Implementation (C++):
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, n = nums.size();
        int count = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) count++;
            while (count > k) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) count--;
                left++;
            }
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity Analysis
- **O(N):** The `right` pointer iterates `N` times, and the `left` pointer moves at most `N` times. Thus, the total time complexity is **O(N)**.

## Space Complexity Analysis
- **O(1):** We use a few integer variables, making the space complexity **constant O(1)**.

---

## Summary
- We use a **sliding window** technique.
- The two-pointer approach ensures efficient traversal in **O(N)** time.
- The algorithm efficiently handles large input sizes within constraints.
