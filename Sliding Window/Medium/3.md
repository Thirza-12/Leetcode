# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```
s = "abcabcbb"
```
**Output:**  
```
3
```
**Explanation:**  
The answer is "abc", with the length of `3`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
```
s = "bbbbb"
```
**Output:**  
```
1
```
**Explanation:**  
The answer is "b", with the length of `1`.

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
```
s = "pwwkew"
```
**Output:**  
```
3
```
**Explanation:**  
The answer is "wke", with the length of `3`. Notice that "pwke" is a subsequence, not a substring.

## Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Using HashMap
This approach uses an **unordered_map** to store the frequency of characters in the substring.

#### Algorithm:
1. Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to track the current window.
2. Use a hash map to store character frequencies.
3. If `s[right]` is already in the window, move `left` until there are no repeating characters.
4. Update the maximum length of the substring.

#### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int left=0, ans=0, n=s.size();
        unordered_map<char, int> mp;
        for(int right=0; right<n; right++) {
            while(left < right && mp[s[right]]) {
                mp[s[left]]--;
                left++;
            }
            mp[s[right]]++;
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Approach 2: Using Boolean Array (Optimized)
Instead of a hash map, we can use a **boolean array** of size 256 (for ASCII characters) to store the presence of a character in the current window.

#### Algorithm:
1. Maintain a boolean array `count` to track characters in the window.
2. If `s[right]` is already in the window, move `left` forward and update the count array.
3. Update the maximum length of the substring.

#### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int left=0, ans=0, n=s.size();
        vector<bool> count(256, false);
        for(int right=0; right<n; right++) {
            while(left < right && count[s[right]]) {
                count[s[left]] = false;
                left++;
            }
            count[s[right]] = true;
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (Each character is visited at most twice, once by `right` and once by `left`)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (Uses a constant-sized data structure for tracking characters)

## Summary
This problem is efficiently solved using the sliding window technique. The optimized approach reduces unnecessary memory usage by utilizing a boolean array instead of a hash map. The overall complexity remains linear, making it suitable for large inputs.
