# Problem: 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

The frequency of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in the array.

An array is called good if the frequency of each element in this array is less than or equal to `k`.

Return the length of the longest good subarray of `nums`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

### Input:
- An array `nums` of integers.
- A positive integer `k`.

### Output:
- The length of the longest subarray in which the frequency of each element is less than or equal to `k`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2]
k = 2
```

**Output:**
```cpp
6
```

**Explanation:**
The longest possible good subarray is `[1,2,3,1,2,3]` since the values 1, 2, and 3 occur at most twice in this subarray. Note that the subarrays `[2,3,1,2,3,1]` and `[3,1,2,3,1,2]` are also good. It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 6.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
k = 1
```

**Output:**
```cpp
2
```

**Explanation:**
The longest possible good subarray is `[1,2]` since the values 1 and 2 occur at most once in this subarray. Note that the subarray `[2,1]` is also good. It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 2.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window of elements such that the frequency of each element in the window is at most `k`.

### Steps:
1. Use two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the window. Initially, both pointers will be at the start of the array.
2. Use a hashmap (`unordered_map`) to count the frequency of each element in the current window.
3. Move the `right` pointer to expand the window. For each element added to the window, update its frequency in the hashmap.
4. If the frequency of any element exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until all frequencies are less than or equal to `k`.
5. Track the maximum length of the window that satisfies the condition.
6. Return the maximum length of such a window.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, n = nums.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        int ans = 0;
        
        // Expand the window by moving the right pointer
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            mp[nums[right]]++;
            
            // Shrink the window by moving the left pointer if the frequency of any element exceeds k
            while (mp[nums[right]] > k) {
                mp[nums[left]]--;
                left++;
            }
            
            // Update the answer with the current valid window size
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of Code:
- We initialize two pointers `left` and `right` and an unordered map `mp` to store the frequency of elements in the current window.
- We move the `right` pointer to expand the window, adding the current element to the map.
- If any element's frequency exceeds `k`, we move the `left` pointer to shrink the window, ensuring all elements' frequencies are at most `k`.
- The `ans` variable stores the maximum length of any valid subarray found.

## Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array. Each element is added to the map once and removed from the map once, leading to a linear time complexity.

## Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array. We use a hashmap to store the frequencies of elements in the window, which could potentially store all elements.
