# Get Equal Substrings Within Budget (Leetcode 1208)

## Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`th character of `s` to the `i`th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
3
```
**Explanation:**
"abc" of `s` can be changed to "bcd" in `t`, which costs 3. The maximum possible length is 3.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
1
```
**Explanation:**
Each character in `s` costs 2 to change to the corresponding character in `t`. So the maximum possible length is 1.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
1
```
**Explanation:**
Since no changes can be made, the maximum length is 1 (a single character itself).

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
- `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution Approach
The problem is solved using the **Sliding Window** technique:
1. Use two pointers: `left` and `right` to form a window.
2. Expand the `right` pointer and calculate the cost of changing `s[right]` to `t[right]`.
3. If the accumulated cost exceeds `maxCost`, shrink the window by moving `left` until the cost is within bounds.
4. Keep track of the maximum valid substring length encountered.

## Code Implementation (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int left = 0, n = s.size();
        int count = 0, ans = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            count += abs(s[right] - t[right]);
            
            while (count > maxCost) {
                count -= abs(s[left] - t[left]);
                left++;
            }
            
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding `right` and once when moving `left`).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as no extra space is used apart from variables.

## Summary
This problem effectively utilizes the **sliding window** technique to find the longest valid substring within a given cost constraint. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the window size by moving `left` whenever the cost exceeds `maxCost`, ensuring an optimal solution in linear time.
